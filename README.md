This project is a clone of the main Tesla website. The goal is to clone all pages(except the support page) to practice both the front end and back end development.

** This is an ongoing project, as I complete the features I'll be upgrading this doc. The finished sections until now are:
 - Main page (desktop and mobile)
 - Model S page (desktop)

### Built With

- [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/)
